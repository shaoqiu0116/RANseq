# RANseq
For bulk RNA-seq, studied the impact of a  treated the cultured DRG neuron samples.
I established a snakemake pipeline for processing FASTQ sequences, alignment with RSEM. Further established an exploratory workflow in jupyter lab, 
with DEseq2 to study the differential expression between groups, and used clusterProfiler to do functional annotation of differential expressed genes.
