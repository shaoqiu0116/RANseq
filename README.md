# RANseq
Studied the impact of a bioactive component from umbilical cord (UC) on on the gene expression of DRG neurons
Established a R pipeline for processing raw FASTQ sequences, alignment with Rsubread. 
Further established an exploratory workflow in jupyter notebbok, with limma and edgeR to study the differential expression 
between groups and used clusterProfiler to do functional annotation of differential expressed genes
